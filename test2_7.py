# Class: Book
# Objective: Create a `Book` class that has two attributes: `title` and `author`.
# The class should also have two methods:
# - `get_title()`: Returns "Title: " followed by the instance title.
# - `get_author()`: Returns "Author: " followed by the instance author.

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
    pass

    def get_title(self):
        return f"Title: {self.title}"
    pass

    def get_author(self):
        return f"Author: {self.author}"
    pass
